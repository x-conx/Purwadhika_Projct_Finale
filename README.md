# Purwadhika Final Project - Credit Card Marketing Acceptance (ONGOING - NOT FINISH YET)

This Project will deliver knowlegde and understanding about Credit Card Marketing that already happend in the past.
The data that collected in this instance will be used for further credit card marketing analysis.

In this sample of data from online source, not many people will accept or willing to have another new credit card.

The raw data from this source is not clearly explain where the data from, what the data is, and how the data is usefull for the marketplace.

In this regards, I can make a guess for the data usage and fuctions for making the prediction.

The data cosist of many features,the one most important is wether the person/cutomer created new creditcard or not.
