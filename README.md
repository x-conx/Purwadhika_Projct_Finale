# Purwadhika Final Project - Credit Card Marketing Acceptance

by: Ryan Natanael Sihono

Dataset: Credit Card Dataset

Source : data.world


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
---

This Project will deliver knowledge and understanding about Credit Card Marketing that already happened in the past.
The data that collected in this instance will be used for further credit card marketing analysis.

In this sample of data from online source, not many people will accept or willing to have another new credit card.

The raw data from this source is not clearly explain where the data from, what the data is, and how the data is useful for the marketplace.

In this regards, I can make a guess for the data usage and functions for making the prediction.

The data consist of many features, the one most important is whether the person/customer created new creditcard or not.
